As an undergrad, I used to think terminal-based text editors like Vim were a nuisance that had to be dealt with in order to work with remote Linux machines. But the more I used Vim, the more I saw how powerful it is. Now, even on my MacBook where I have access to any GUI text editor I want, I do almost all my coding and text editing on Vim in a terminal. If you think of Vim as a necessary evil instead of a powerful tool for productivity as a coder, my goal is to convince you that it's worth spending a little time learning how to use Vim. You won't regret it.

Just learning a few of the basic keystrokes can be enough to increase your productivity over other editors, and your productivity only increases the more you learn. If you already use something good like Emacs, then you're probably doing fine. I'm not going to get into that [debate](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/986/what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-vim-and-emacs), mostly because I have no experience with Emacs.

There are plenty of [Vim tutorials](http://www.labnol.org/internet/learning-vim-for-beginners/28820/) out there like [this one](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_02.html), so instead of listing the basic commands to get you around Vim, I'll list my favorite things about Vim so you know what to look for.
