Computer Science majors are expected to be well versed in version control software like Git, Mercurial, or SVN. [Version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control), a.k.a. revision control or source control, is essential for any large software projects with multiple contributors. Chemical Engineering Majors like myself, on the other hand, (and many other science and engineering majors I suspect) don't get exposed to the idea of version control because multi-developer programming isn't a fundamental concept in the program. This is unfortunate for those of use who end up doing computational research.

The kind of code I'm using in my research isn't enormous (~3000 lines of code), and changes are made infrequently enough that I can survive without version control. Even so, every minute I've spent learning Git has been absolutely worth it. Now that I've used it for a while and seen what it can do, I firmly believe that Git is an invaluable tool for anyone, even individual developers, who works with code that's more than a couple hundred lines long.

Here are the things that Git helps out with, in addition to facilitating collaboration:

##Backing up code
[GitHub](http://github.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) are free services that work great with Git. Once your code is connected to either of these services, just a couple commands will push Typically, you'll have your code set up as a Git is a *distributed* version control system, meaning that each copy of the code, or repository, contains a f
##Keeping code up to date on multiple machines
##Making my research results reproducible
##Keeping my code clean
