I am a PhD student at UPenn working in Rob Riggleman's [Computational Polymer Nanocomposites Lab](http://rrgroup.seas.upenn.edu). My research is currently focused on studying nanoparticle interactions in and around diblock copolymer domains using field theoretic simulation. I'm also interested in other types of scientific computing, particularly machine learning.
